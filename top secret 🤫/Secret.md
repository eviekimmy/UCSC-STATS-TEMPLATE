In undergrad, I did not hear the work "Bayesian" that much. I would have previously pronounced it "BayeZian." So at the open house, when everyone at UCSC was saying the work Bayesian, my mind did not immediately register it as the statistical term. Instead, I thought people were meaning mixed race, like someone who is half Black and half Asian. This caused a lot of confusion. For example, I remember some of the upper class-men would ask each other "Are you Bayesian" and somewhat chuckle, and I was so confused on whether this was some weird inside joke or something. At one point one of the upper class-men said "I think the most of the department is Bayesian" and I was starting to feel like I was in the Twilight Zone. While I try to not assume race, it was safe to say that most of the department was not, in fact, Black-Asian. Fortunately, no one asked me if I was Bayesian, as that would have made for a REALLY awkward conversation. Not only do I have to break the news that I, someone who is neither Black nor Asian, am not Bayesian, that person would then have to explain to me that they meant the statistical term "Bayesian," not the bi-racial category. It was not until around 4ish that it finally clicked what everyone actually meant. I decided I was gonna wait awhile before telling everyone this story. Now you know. Hopefully you were entertained.
